# Smart-Traffic-Fine-Management-System
The Smart Traffic Fine Management System is a Python-based application designed to assist traffic police departments in automatically calculating traffic fines based on predefined rules. This system reduces manual effort, ensures consistency in fine calculation, and promotes road safety by enforcing traffic regulations efficiently.

The program takes essential driver details such as driver name, age, vehicle speed, and seatbelt usage as inputs. Based on these inputs, it evaluates multiple conditions including speed limit violations, seatbelt compliance, and underage driving. If the driver exceeds the speed limit, an appropriate fine is applied according to the severity of the violation. An additional fine is added if the driver is not wearing a seatbelt.

The system also prioritizes safety and legality by immediately flagging underage drivers (below 18 years) and displaying a warning message instead of calculating a fine. If no traffic rules are violated, the system reassures the driver with a safety message.

Overall, this project demonstrates the practical use of conditional statements, user input handling, and real-world rule-based logic in Python. It is well-suited for beginners and is often used as a mini-project for academic purposes, showcasing how programming can solve real-life problems in traffic management and law enforcement.
